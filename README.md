# WordPress Help Center Module

Help Center


## Critical Paths

* `Help Center` icon should be visible in the top WordPress admin bar for users with the required capabilities.
* Clicking the `Help Center` icon should open a sidebar with an introduction and search field to help users navigate WordPress.
* The `Help Center` sidebar should allow users to type a question and receive a list of suggested help articles.
* When submitting a search, the sidebar should display a highlighted question and related answers.
* Users should be able to provide feedback on the answer by selecting if it was helpful or not, and optionally provide a reason if it wasnâ€™t.
* The `Help Center` should include a footer section with information about professional design services and a button to start the process.
* The sidebar must include support contact information for users who need assistance with their account.
* Clicking the close icon should properly dismiss the `Help Center` sidebar and return to the previous view.
* A tooltip should be available to show a list of recent or suggested questions when triggered by the user.
